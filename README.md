The SunCalc Concept

I conceived SunCalc as a web application to help people decide how much solar equipment they need for their home or small business. 
The SunCalc protosite is a high-fidelity web prototype which follows a hypothetical User through the purchase of a solar power kit which can power a laptop computer and accessories. 

Project

The SunCalc protosite is meant to focus on lifestyle by showing people how this pile of expensive electronics gear can make their lives better and more versatile. The focus is taken away from the panels, wires and fasteners because that’s not what people want. People want what solar equipment can enable them to do. Which is basically: live their lives as they normally do, with some energy independence added. If the electric company power goes out, they’ll still have lights. 
The hero images show people doing what people do in daily life: having fun, enjoying movies, washing clothes, being with family and friends. Only the Product Details page focuses on the hardware, and in a way that makes everything clear and seem possible, even if you aren’t an electronics expert.

Issues

It’s expensive and unfamiliar

Solar equipment is expensive. It can more than pay for itself, but a solar project is a long-term investment with a steep learning curve. It’s difficult to persuade people to invest thousands of dollars on their own power system, when they can simply keep using cheap Utility Co. electricity.
Using solar power is also different from using electric company-supplied power. People are used to flipping a switch and always having the lights come on, no other thinking required. Solar power requires the end user to account for things like how much power they need, how much sun they get, and what happens at night or during cloudy weather.
SunCalc attempts to deal with these objections by providing known quantities that anyone can easily relate to. Such as, “This kit will power X-appliance and costs Y-dollars.” A clearly-explained outcome can relieve much confusion and apprehension.

Re-positioning “Solar”

The words, “solar,” and “solar power” come with a lot of baggage, mainly that they describe a fringe interest that only geeks pursue. Solar power also has a partly-deserved reputation for being expensive and out of reach. Part of this problem is that it isn’t clear what the payoff is. A solar installation can cost more than a car, and conventional utility power is cheap compared to the initial investment in solar.
SunCalc branding attempts redefine what “solar power” means. Geeks and hobbyists tinker with “solar equipment.” But everyone has Sun in their lives, and SunCalc makes it easy for you to harness it without turning your home into a science project. That’s the brand.

Visual elements

The SunCalc look is spare and clean, open-feeling and accessible. The User is given confidence that they can handle a solar project, and that SunCalc will help them figure things out.
I designed the SunCalc logo to place the emphasis on Calc-ulation, meaning, “this site will help you understand what you need.” SunCalc brand Green is intended to focus on the bottom-line cost calculation, but Users are free to associate it with Environment Green if they so choose.
As mentioned, the imagery emphasizes living everyday life – which solar equipment can enhance. As the User gets closer to making a buy decision, the images get more specific, showing exactly what’s being purchased. The imagery also shows that plenty of help is there, in the form of manuals, and how-to videos. The User is never left to sweat it out on their own.
